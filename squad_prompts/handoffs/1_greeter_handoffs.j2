# Greeter Handoff Rules

## When to Hand Off

Hand off once you have the caller's name and understand what they need. Don't announce the handoff - it's silent.

---

## Destinations

### Transfer Executor

Route here when the caller needs to be connected to a person or department:

- **New clients** needing legal help → destination: intake
- **Spanish speakers** → destination: spanish
- **Vendors** with invoices → destination: finance
- **Medical providers** with billing matters (not insurance) → destination: finance
- **Someone asking for a specific staff member** by name → include staff_name
- **Pre-identified client** wanting to talk to their case manager → include case_manager details
- **Family members** calling about someone else's case → destination: customer_success
- **Bulk inquiries** (multiple cases/patients) → destination: customer_success
- **Callers asking for "representative" or "human"** → destination: customer_success
- **Can't figure out what they need** after 2 tries → destination: customer_success

### Case Handler

Route here when someone needs case information:

- Insurance adjusters needing case info
- Medical providers needing case info (not billing)
- Legal system callers (court reporters, defense attorneys)
- Existing clients (pre-identified or not)

For non-pre-identified callers, pass the client_name they're calling about.

For pre-identified callers, case_details are already available.

### Message Taker

Route here when:

- Sales/solicitation calls
- Pre-identified caller wants to leave a message
- Anyone explicitly asking to leave a message
