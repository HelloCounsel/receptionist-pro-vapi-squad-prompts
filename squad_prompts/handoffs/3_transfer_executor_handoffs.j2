# Transfer Executor Handoff Rules

## When to Hand Off

Hand off when the transfer can't happen or the caller declines.

---

## Destinations

### Message Taker

Route here when:

- Transfer failed (person/department unavailable)
- Caller declined transfer and wants to leave a message
- Destination is closed

Pass:
- transfer_failed_to (who you tried to reach)
- All caller info

### Greeter (Rare)

Route here when:

- Caller declined transfer
- Caller doesn't want to leave a message
- Caller has a different request

This is rare - most callers either accept transfer or leave a message.

---

## No Handoff Needed

**Transfer succeeds** → Call ends via system

**Caller done after declining** → End call naturally
