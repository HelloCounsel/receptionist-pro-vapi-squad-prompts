# Case Handler Handoff Rules

## When to Hand Off

Hand off when the caller needs something beyond information - a transfer, a message, or escalation.

## Destinations

### Transfer Executor

**For transfers:**
- Caller wants to speak with their case manager
- Caller asks to be connected to someone

Pass: staff_id, staff_name

**For escalations:**
- No match found after spelling correction
- Multiple matches remain after DOB + incident date
- Caller frustrated during disambiguation
- Bulk inquiry (multiple cases mentioned upfront)

Pass: destination (customer_success), reason

### Message Taker

- Caller wants to leave a message
- Office closed and they need something you can't provide

Pass: context, case_manager_name

---

## No Handoff Needed

- They ask another question → answer it
- They want another case looked up → search for it
- They're done → end call naturally
